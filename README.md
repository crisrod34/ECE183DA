Code for Design of Robotic Systems (ECE183DA)  
This course was designed by Professor Ankur Mehta, all formal lab exercises and problem sets are credited to him.

This repo contains our code and data for running paperbot and segway simulations. 

## Simulation Instructions: 

In order to run the paperbot simulation:
  - navigate to the folder named 
  - Run the file named lab2_paperbot.py
  
In order to run the segway simulation:
  - Run the file named lab2_segway.py
