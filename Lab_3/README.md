# ECE183DA - Joint Lab 3  

This repo contains our code and data for the joint lab 3, simulation of various trajectories using Python, Solidworks & Webots. 
## Inputs:
This folder contains all our input data, stored in different excel sheets for each different trajectory.
## Outputs:
This folder contains all our output data for running the simulation in Python. Each excel sheet has a different trajectory.
## Plots:
This folder contains all of the relevant plots that were created in Python using our output data.

## Simulation Instructions: 

In order to run the paperbot simulation:
  - Navigate to the folder named 'Paperbot_files'
  - Download the file named 'paperbot_code.py' and the folder named 'Inputs'
  - Place the Python code into the same folder as the excel sheets found in 'Inputs'
  - Run the file named 'paperbot_code.py'
  
In order to run the segway simulation:
  - Navigate to the folder named 'Segway_files'
  - Download the file named 'segway_code.py' and the folder named 'Inputs'
  - Place the Python code into the same folder as the excel sheets found in 'Inputs'
  - Run the file named 'segway_code.py'
